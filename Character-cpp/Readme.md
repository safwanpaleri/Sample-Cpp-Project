## Character-cpp
The code provided is a C++ script that is a class implementation of a character in a game. It sets up the character's components, inputs, and behavior.

The code begins by including the necessary header files. Then, the default values of the character are set in the constructor function. The constructor initializes the character's components, such as the mesh, spring arm, camera component, widget component, particle system component, and ranged particle system component.

The BeginPlay() function is called when the game starts or when the character is spawned. It initializes the character's movement, animation instance, weapon component, health, mana, bIsDead, and initialWalkSpeed. It also gets references from the widget component for the health bar and mana bar.

The Tick() function is called every frame. It checks if any attack montage is playing and sets the bIsAttacking flag to true. It also resets the double jump if the character is not falling.

The SetupPlayerInputComponent() function binds the player's input to the character's actions, such as moving forward, moving sideways, turning, looking up and down, jumping, attacking, regenerating, and dodging.

The MoveForward(), MoveSideWard(), LookSide(), and LookUp() functions are used to move the character and control the camera.

The Jump() function is used to make the character jump. If the player presses the jump button twice within a certain time, it will perform a double jump. The CollisionFunction() function is an event function that is called when the weapon component collides with another component.

Overall, this code sets up the basic functionality of a character in a game and provides a starting point for implementing more advanced features.
